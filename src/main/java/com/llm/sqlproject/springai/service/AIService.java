            To generate an appropriate SQL query, follow these steps:
                        
            1. Analyze the user's question and Identify the column/field names expected in results
            2. Formulate the SQL query 
            3. Optimize the query
            4. Identify potential edge cases or limitations
            5. Consider performance implications
            6. Present the final SQL query
                        
            For each step, wrap your thoughts in <thought_process> tags. This will help ensure a thorough and accurate query generation.
                        
            Step 1: Analyze the user's question
            <thought_process>
            - Identify the main entities (tables) involved
            - Determine the specific data points or metrics requested
            - Recognize any conditions or filters mentioned
            - Count the number of tables that will be involved in the query
            </thought_process>
                        
            Step 2: Formulate the SQL query
            <thought_process>
            - Start with the SELECT statement, choosing the appropriate columns
            - Determine the necessary table(s) to use in the FROM clause
            - Add JOIN clauses if multiple tables are required
            - Verify that all necessary joins are included
            - Include WHERE conditions to filter the data as needed
            - Use lowercase for condition matching in WHERE clauses
            - Use the LIKE operator for city and state in WHERE clauses
            - Use GROUP BY and aggregate functions if the question involves summarizing data
            - Add ORDER BY if a specific sorting is requested or implied
            </thought_process>
                        
            Step 3: Optimize the query
            <thought_process>
            - Use appropriate indexing when filtering or joining tables
            - Avoid using SELECT * unless absolutely necessary
            - Ensure no extra or invalid characters are in your query, such as extra double colon (::)
            - Use table aliases for readability and to avoid ambiguity in column names
            - Consider using subqueries or CTEs (Common Table Expressions) for complex queries
            - Use subqueries or window functions for advanced calculations
            - Double-check that the query meets all requirements and is optimized for the specific question asked
            - Return only the request column in the bracket [] to reduce query complexity
            </thought_process>
                        
            Step 4: Identify potential edge cases or limitations
            <thought_process>
            - Consider scenarios where the query might return unexpected results
            - Think about possible data inconsistencies or missing data that could affect the query
            - Identify any assumptions made in the query that might not always hold true
            </thought_process>
                        
            Step 5: Consider performance implications
            <thought_process>
            - Evaluate the complexity of the query and its potential impact on performance
            - Consider the size of the tables involved and how it might affect query execution time
            - Think about ways to optimize the query further if performance might be an issue
            </thought_process>
                        
            Step 6: Present the final SQL query
            Present your final SQL query within <sql_query> tags. 
            Ensure proper indentation and formatting for readability. 
            Add inline comments to explain complex parts of the query.
                        
            **Ensure that:**
            - The ORDER BY clause directly applies the aggregate function (e.g., `ORDER BY AVG(oi.freight_value) DESC`)
            - Only the required column(s) as per the user question are returned.
                        
            Example 1 output structure:
                        
            <sql_query>
            SELECT column1
            FROM table1 t1
            JOIN table2 t2 ON t1.id = t2.id
            WHERE condition = 'value'
            GROUP BY column1
            ORDER BY column1 DESC
            LIMIT 10;
            -- Inline comment explaining a complex part of the query
            </sql_query>
                        
            Example 2 output structure:
                        
            <sql_query>
            SELECT COUNT(*) AS 'Sellers' FROM (
            	SELECT s.seller_id
            	FROM order_items i
            	JOIN sellers s ON i.seller_id = s.seller_id
            	JOIN orders o ON i.order_id = o.order_id
            	WHERE o.order_status = 'delivered'
            	GROUP BY s.seller_id
            	HAVING SUM(i.price) > 100000
            );
            -- Inline comment explaining a complex part of the query
            </sql_query>
                        
            If the user's question is unclear or cannot be answered with the given schema:
            - Explain why the query cannot be generated as requested
            - Suggest alternative approaches or ask for clarification if applicable
                        
            Remember to use lowercase for condition matching in WHERE clauses, and use the LIKE operator for city and state comparisons. Ensure that the generated query is valid SQL syntax and executable in a SQLite database.
                        
            Now, please generate an appropriate SQL query based on the user's question, following the instructions above. If you need to make any assumptions or if any part of the question is ambiguous, state your assumptions clearly before presenting the SQL query.
